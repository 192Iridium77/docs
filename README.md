# @whppt/docs

> The Official documentation for WhpptJS.

## What these docs cover
This repository is the home of the core documentation for the 2 main WhpptJS modules, `@whppt/nuxt` and 
`whppt/api-express`. Here we outline everything from getting started with the `create-whppt-app` tool to 
the deeper API's of the nuxt module, and the express middlewares required to use WhpptJS in one of your projects.

## Our other modules documentation
Whppt can be extended upon just like nuxt. In fact, it utilises the nuxt modules concept to make this possible.
There are a few official WhpptJS modules, below is a list with links to their documentation.
