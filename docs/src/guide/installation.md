# Getting Started

## Requirements

Welcome to WhpptJS, before you get started you're going to need a few things.
    - Node
    - npm/yarn
    - MongoDB 4 (Less that v4 is currently untested)

## Installation

Creating a new Whppt App can be a bit of work, so to help you get started we've created a tool to quickly 
spin up a new Whppt app.

```shell
npx create-whppt-app <app-name>
```

Where `<app-name>` is the name of the directory that will be created.

Once run, you will be prompted for a few things, very similar to the prompts found when creating a 
new NuxtJS app.
